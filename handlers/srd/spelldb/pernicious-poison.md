### Description

You weaken the targets defenses against poison. The target gains a 4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a 4 penalty.

## Mythic Pernicious Poison

The number of successful saving throws needed to cure a poison increases by one. If the poison deals ability damage on a failed saving throw, that ability damage increases by 1.  

**Augmented (6th)**Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the targets penalty on saves against poison increases to 8, and the penalty for attempting to cure the target with skill or magic increases to 8.  

If you expend three uses of mythic power, the poison bypasses the creatures poison immunity (this doesnt affect poison immunity from not having a Constitution score).
