# Spell: Infuse Robot

^([Technology Guide][ss-infuse-robot] pg. 9 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-infuse-robot])

**School** transmutation; **Level** arcanist 7, cleric/oracle 7, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, warpriest 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  

**Target** one robot  

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D)  

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

If the targeted robot fails its Will saving throw, it transforms into a magical construct made of wood, stone, flesh, or bone. The robots statistics and abilities do not change, although it is now a magical construct rather than a technological one. It loses the robot subtype, but does not lose its Intelligence score (if any). You can issue mental commands to the infused robot as long as it stays within range of the spell; issuing commands in this manner is a free action for you. When the spells duration runs out, the robot transforms back to normal but is staggered for 1d4 rounds.
