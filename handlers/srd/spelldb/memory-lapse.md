# Spell: Memory Lapse

^([Advanced Player's Guide][ss-memory-lapse] pg. 232 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-memory-lapse])

**School** enchantment [mind-affecting]; **Level** arcanist 1, bard 1, skald 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.

## Mythic Memory Lapse

The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn.

**Augmented (3rd)**Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using _[modify memory]_ but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldnt implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldnt happen in the forgotten length of time.

The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the _[mythic memory lapse]_ DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.
