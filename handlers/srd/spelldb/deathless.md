### Description

The targets soul is strongly anchored to its body, preventing death from hit point damage. No matter how low the targets hit points get, it remains alive (though not necessarily conscious).  

This spell doesnt prevent death from sources other than hit point damagesuch as Constitution damage or drain, death effects, or energy drain. Spells that cure hit points affect the creature normally.

## Mythic Deathless

If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you become an anchor for the souls of you and your cohorts. The range increases to 30 feet, and instead of affecting one creature, it affects all allies within a 30-footradius emanation centered on you.   

**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, and the area to a 1-mileradius emanation centered on you.
