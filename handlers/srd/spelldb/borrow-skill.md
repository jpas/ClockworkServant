### Description

You borrow one of the targets known skills. After touching the subject, you can make a single check with the chosen skill using the subjects skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability. If you take longer than the spells duration to make the check or the check requires more time, then it fails and you must use your own skill ranks (if any). If the borrowed skill is a class skill for you, you gain the +3 bonus on checks using that skill.
