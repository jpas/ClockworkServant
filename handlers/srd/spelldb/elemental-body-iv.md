## Mythic Elemental Body IV

Each _[mythic elemental body]_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _[elemental body]_ spell to learn its mythic version. You dont have to learn them in order, and arent required to know a lower-level _[mythic elemental body]_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic elemental body II_ if you know _elemental body II_, even if you dont know _mythic elemental body I_). Each _[mythic elemental body]_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. The spells bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing _[medium fortification]_ armor.  

**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).
