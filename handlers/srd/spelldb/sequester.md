# Spell: Sequester

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-sequester] pg. 340 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-sequester])

**School** abjuration; **Level** arcanist 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a basilisk eyelash and gum arabic)

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** one willing creature or object (up to a 2-ft. cube/level) touched  

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)  

**Saving Throw** none or Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** no or yes (object)

### Description

When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the _[invisibility]_ spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by _[sequester]_ become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.  

_Note_: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.
