### Description

You create an area of total darkness. The darkness is impenetrable even to darkvision, but you can see normally within it. Creatures outside the spells area, even you, cannot see through it.  

You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance. _Blacklight_ counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. _Daylight_ counters or dispels _[blacklight]_.
