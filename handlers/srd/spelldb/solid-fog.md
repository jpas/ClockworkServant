### Description

This spell functions like _[fog cloud]_, but in addition to obscuring sight, the _[solid fog]_ is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a solid fog move at half their normal speed and take a 2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into _[solid fog]_ is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in _[solid fog]_. _Solid fog_, and effects that work like _[solid fog]_, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.  

Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.  

_Solid fog_ can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_ spell. A permanent _[solid fog]_ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

## Mythic Solid Fog

The penalty on melee attack and damage rolls increases to 4. The clouds radius and height both increase to 50 feet.  

**Augmented**: The augmented version of _[mythic solid fog]_ has the same additional benefits as the augmented version of _[mythic fog cloud]_.
