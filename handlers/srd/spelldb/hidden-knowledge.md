### Description

This subtle but useful spell allows the caster to safeguard important knowledgeeven from himself. While casting this spell, you recite one piece of knowledge you possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). Upon completion of the spells casting, you transfer the knowledge from your mind to your skin in the form of an intricate, runic tattoo placed anywhere you choose on your body. The knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches over gaps in your memory with recollections from the past. Until the spells duration ends, the knowledge is lost to you.  

Many cyphermages commission nonmagical tattoos to disguise the effects of this spell. A _[detect magic]_ spell or a Decipher Script check (DC 15 + your Int modifier) reveals an enchanted tattoo but not its contents. The effects of _[hidden knowledge]_ can be dispelled normally, in which case the knowledge is completely lost.
