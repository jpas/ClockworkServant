^([Blood of the Night][ss-transmute-wine-to-blood] pg. 30 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-transmute-wine-to-blood])

**School** transmutation; **Level** arcanist 2, cleric/oracle 2, red mantis assassin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, warpriest 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (drop of animal blood)

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** bottle of wine worth at least 10 gp  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

### Description

You transform one bottle of fine wine into 1 pint of animal blood, sufficient for a creature with the blood drain ability to feed upon as if it came from a Medium animal with 1 Hit Die. If you are using the optional hunger rules (see page 22), this blood satiates an undead creatures hunger, negating any withdrawal effects, but does not grant the creature a feeding bonus. The blood coagulates and spoils at the normal rate.
