### Description

This spell wreathes you in shadowy energy and damages those that make melee attacks against you. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage. When an attacker takes damage from the spell, you heal a number of hit points equal to 25% of the damage the spell dealt.
