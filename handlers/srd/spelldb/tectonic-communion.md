### Description

_Tectonic communion _functions as _[commune with nature]_ with an even greater range. In outdoor or natural underground settings, the spell operates on a radius of 100 miles per caster level, extending even underground without penalty.  

For every 2 caster levels above 13th, you may glean an additional fact from the list presented in _[commune with nature]_. Communities, dungeons, and signs of civilization (such as roads, farms or other constructions and settlements) exist as dark and unknowable blots in your perception of the spells area; youre aware of their location and existence, but cant discern any information regarding them.
