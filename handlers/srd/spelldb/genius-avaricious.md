### Description

Casting this spell constitutes performing a rite of sacrifice to the archdevil Mammon, making an offering to the Lord of Erebus and channeling a measure of his disembodied might into a single coin. The power and abilities of this vestige correspond directly to the value of the offering, allowing for three distinct effects.  

_Corrupted Coin_: Making a sacrifice worth 1,500 gp corrupts the focus into a lucky or unlucky coin as per the casters will for 1 month. Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Cra", and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spell _[augury]_ once per dayits flip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses.  

_Mammons Mantle_: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearers blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no benefit). The coins effects last for 1 day per caster level.  

_Gold Guardian_: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard (see previous page) forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. A"er this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creatures hit points by 1 per day. When the guardians hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points.  

In addition to the effects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in effect is born as a tiefling (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself ).
