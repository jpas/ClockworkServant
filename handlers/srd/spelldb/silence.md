### Description

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a _[silence]_ spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.

## Mythic Silence

This spell also applies to telepathy, cutting off any mental communication within the area. At the time of casting, you can choose to be immune to your own _[mythic silence]_ effect and can designate up to one creature per tier to also gain this immunity. Creatures immune to the _[mythic silence]_ are subject to sonic effects as normal.
