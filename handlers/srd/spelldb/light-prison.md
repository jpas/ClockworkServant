### Description

Rays of light burst forth from your outstretched hand, encircling each targets space with a cage of light. If a target fails its Reflex save, it becomes enclosed in the _[light prison]_. A creature enclosed in a _[light prison]_ can attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally as long as it stays within the _[light prison]_. However, if a creature passes through the walls of a _[light prison]_ enclosing it, it takes 1d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. Creatures do not receive saves to negate these effects. Once a creature passes through the walls of a _[light prison]_ surrounding it, the effect ends for that creature.
