**Casting Time** 1 round  

**Components** V, S, F (crystal or gem receptacle worth at least 25 gp)

**Target** one dying or recently dead creature  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You draw forth the ebbing life force of a dying creature or one that has died in the past round, forcing it into a crystal or gem receptacle and creating a _[soul gem]_. If the creature is alive and fails its saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, you automatically capture the soul. The value of the _[soul gem]_ depends on the nature of the creature it is made from (see The Soul Trade on page 30).  

If you are a souldrinker (see page 34), you may cast this spell and expend 5 soul points to fill the gem with the equivalent of one basic soul.  

Only one _[soul gem]_ can be created from a particular dying creature. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a _[soul gem]_ requires a caster check against a DC of 11 + your caster level at the time you cast this spell. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success shatters the targets _[soul gem]_ and returns the creature to life as normal. If the _[soul gem]_ resides in an unholy location, such as that created by the _[unhallow]_ spell, the DC of this check increases by +2.
