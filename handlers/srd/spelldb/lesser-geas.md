### Description

A _[lesser geas]_ places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.  

The _[geased]_ creature must follow the given instructions until the _[geas]_ is completed, no matter how long it takes.  

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.  

If the subject is prevented from obeying the _[lesser geas]_ for 24 hours, it takes a 2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another 2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of 8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the _[lesser geas]_.  

A _[lesser geas]_ (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by _[break enchantment]_, _[limited wish]_, _[remove curse]_, _[miracle]_, or _[wish]_. _Dispel magic_ does not affect a _[lesser geas]_.
