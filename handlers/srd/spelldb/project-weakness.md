# Spell: Project Weakness

^([Blood of the Night][ss-project-weakness] pg. 30 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-project-weakness])

**School** necromancy [curse, evil]; **Level** arcanist 4, cleric/oracle 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, warpriest 3, witch 3 (vampire)

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** living creature touched  

**Duration** permanent  

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism. The creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as if it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target; anything that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you are a moroi vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful effect is removed. The target gains none of the benefits of being a vampire (such as fast healing or requiring special ways to be permanently killed), only the penalties.
