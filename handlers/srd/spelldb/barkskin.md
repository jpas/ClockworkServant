**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 2, druid 2, hunter 2, investigator 2, ranger 2, shaman 2, summoner 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** living creature touched  

**Duration** 10 min./level  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

### Description

_Barkskin_ toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.  

The enhancement bonus provided by _[barkskin]_ stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

## Mythic Barkskin

The target also gains DR/magic equal to the double the enhancement bonus the spell provides to the targets natural armor bonus.  

**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell grants DR/epic rather than DR/magic.
