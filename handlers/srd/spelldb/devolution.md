**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

### Description

This spell causes an eidolon to lose one evolution plus one additional evolution for every five caster levels. Evolutions with the highest total cost are lost first. If there is a tie, randomly determine which is lost. If this spell causes an eidolon to fail to meet the prerequisites for other evolutions or abilities, those evolutions or abilities are lost as long as this spell persists.

## Mythic Devolution

The saving throw changes to Will (partial). If it succeeds at its save, the eidolon loses one evolution, chosen at random.
