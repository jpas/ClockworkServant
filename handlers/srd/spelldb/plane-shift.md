# Spell: Plane Shift

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-plane-shift] pg. 322 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-plane-shift])

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** arcanist 7, cleric/oracle 5, shaman 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, warpriest 5, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane of travel)

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the _[plane shift]_ at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. _Plane shift_ transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting _[plane shift]_ again).

## Mythic Plane Shift

If youve been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.   

**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a _[planar adaptation]_ spell (_Advanced Players Guide_ 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.
