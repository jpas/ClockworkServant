### Description

When you would be hit by an attack that requires an attack roll, you may cast this spell to compel the target to throw itself in front of the blow, taking damage from the attack instead of you. After taking damage, the target is shaken for 1 minute. If you target your animal companion, familiar, or fiendish servant with this spell while it is already shaken, it becomes frightened after intercepting the attack.  

If the attack involves multiple attack rolls from a single effect (e.g., _[scorching ray]_), the target intercepts all attacks. If the attack involves multiple attack rolls from natural attacks or iterative attacks, it intercepts only one attack.  

If the spell affects an area, the target instead grants you cover against the effect (+2 bonus on Reflex saves) if it is your size or smaller, or improved cover (+4 on Reflex saves and improved evasion against the effect) if it is larger than you. The target automatically fails its Reflex save against the effect, but may still benefit from effects such as improved evasion.  

This spell has no effect on attacks that do not require an attack roll or affect an area. Your animal companion, familiar, or fiendish servant must be adjacent to you at the time of casting or this spell has no effect.
