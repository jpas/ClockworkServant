### Description

An invisible force pulls together the remains of a shipwreck. Bits of hull, tattered sails, broken masts, and smashed figureheads knit themselves back together. Rotten wood turns solid once more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the masts.  

It takes a variable amount of time for the ship to rebuild itself, depending on its size.  

**Size**| **Duration**  
---|---  
Raft| 1 minute  
Rowboat| 1 minute  
Keelboat| 10 minutes  
Longship| 1 hour  
Sailing ship| 2 hours  
Warship| 3 hours  
Galleon| 4 hours  

At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water.  

Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A _[salvage]d_ ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spells duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, _[salvage]_ can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new _[salvage]_ spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new _[salvage]_ spells duration is modified by any repairs already begun.
