^([Advanced Player's Guide][ss-ball-lightning] pg. 204 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-ball-lightning])

**School** evocation [air, electricity]; **Level** arcanist 4, bloodrager 4, druid 4, hunter 4, magus 4, shaman 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a small iron ring)

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying spheres course.

If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a 4 penalty on this saving throw.

Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (its a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A _[ball lightning]_ globe winks out if it exceeds the spells range.
