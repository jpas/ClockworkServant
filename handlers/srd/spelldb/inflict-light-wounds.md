### Description

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5).  

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.

## Mythic Inflict Light Wounds

The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 5 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.
