### Description

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a 1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A _[slowed]_ creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.  

Multiple _[slow]_ effects don't stack. _Slow_ counters and dispels _[haste]_.

## Mythic Slow

The penalty on attack rolls, on Reflex saves, and to AC increases to 2, and affected creatures move at one-fourth speed. Select one affected creature; this creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
