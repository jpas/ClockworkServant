^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-entropic-shield] pg. 278 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-entropic-shield])

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric/oracle 1, warpriest 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

### Description

A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.

## Mythic Entropic Shield

When a ranged attack misses because of this spell, there is a 50% chance that the attack is redirected back at the attacker rather than just being deflected harmlessly. The attack uses the same result as the attack roll the attacker made against you.
