### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a chunk of adamantine worth 100 gp, or a chunk of cold iron or silver worth 20 gp)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Targets** one weapon per level  

**Duration** 1 minute/level (see text)  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

You lend the nature of adamantine, cold iron, or silver to the targeted weapons, with the following effects:  

_Adamantine_: The weapons overcome DR/adamantine and ignore hardness less than 20.  

_Cold Iron_: The weapons overcome DR/cold iron.  

_Silver_: The weapons overcome DR/silver.  

No other advantages or disadvantages of these metal types apply. For example, a weapon given the nature of adamantine is not automatically masterwork.  

This is able to affect nonmetal weapons. If you grant the target weapons the property of cold iron, the spell lasts half as long as normal.
