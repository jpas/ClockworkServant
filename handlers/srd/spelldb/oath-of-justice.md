### Description

This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures. When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath in Kolss name. The spell functions like _[mark of justice]_, except as noted above and rather than being cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the face indicating to all dwarves who see it that the target has broken a sacred oath, which gives the oath-breaker a 4 penalty to influence dwarves. The mark can be removed as described in the _[mark of justice]_ spell, or the other target can forgive the oathbreaker, which causes the mark to vanish.
