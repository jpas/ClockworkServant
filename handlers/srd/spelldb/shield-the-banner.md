### Description

This spell is used to protect one of a tribes most valuable possessions: its tribal banner. Any creature (other than a member of the tribe which the standard represents) attempting to directly attack or touch the standard must make a Will save. This spell functions as _[sanctuary]_, but only protects a standard or banner. In addition, the spell grants a +2 bonus to the standards hardness, and +10 to the standards hit points for the duration of the spell.
