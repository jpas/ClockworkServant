### Description

You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The _[illusory script]_ appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character.  

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a _[suggestion]_ implanted in the script by you at the time the _[illusory script]_ spell was cast. The _[suggestion]_ lasts only 30 minutes. Typical _[suggestions]_ include Close the book and leave, Forget the existence of this note, and so forth. If successfully dispelled by _[dispel magic]_, the _[illusory script]_ and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the _[true seeing]_ spell with the _[read magic]_ or _[comprehend languages]_ spell.
