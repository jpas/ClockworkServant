**School** evocation [fire, good, light]; **Level** bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, magus 6, skald 6, warpriest 6 (Sarenrae)

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 round/level

### Description

You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. Half of this damage is fire damage and half is holy damage (as the spell flame strike). An undead creature or a creature particularly vulnerable to light that hits you instead takes 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination equivalent to a _[daylight]_ spell. You can have only one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as _[fire shield]_ or _shield of the Dawnflower _(_The Inner Sea World Guide _296).
