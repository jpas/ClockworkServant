**Effect** fog spreads in 20-ft. radius  

**Duration** 10 min./level  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).  

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.  

The spell does not function underwater.

## Mythic Fog Cloud

The radius of the fog increases to 50 feet.   

**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the fogs radius changes to 500 feet, and its height changes to 100 feet. Winds cant dissipate the fog unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of the augmented _[mythic fog cloud]_. If youre at least 6th tier and instead expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the fogs radius changes to 1 mile, and its height changes to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind as the 3rd-tier augmented version.
