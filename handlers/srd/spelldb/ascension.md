**Casting Time** 1 hour  

**Components** V, S, F (minor artifact), M (10,000 gp in rare herbs, gems, and other exotic materials)

### Effect

**Target** one non-mythic creature/3 levels  

**Duration** 2 hours/level; see text  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

### Description

You imbue a number of creatures with mythic power, granting each of them 1st tier in a mythic path of its choice. The creatures immediately gain the benefits of their chosen paths. Divide the duration evenly among all targets.  

The targets retain their mythic tier only while theyre within 100 feet of the spells focus component. A target that goes outside this range loses its mythic tier, but instantly regains it if it moves into range again. If the focus component is destroyed while the spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.

## Mythic Ascension

If you expend one use of mythic power when casting this spell, the duration increases to 1 day per level, and you can use yourself as the focus for this spell instead of a lesser artifact. If youre the focus, the targets retain their mythic tier only while theyre within 100 feet of you, and if you die, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.
