* Gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

* Cast a single spell of 2nd level or lower as if it were an enlarged, extended, silent, or still spell.

Cast a single spell of 2nd level or lower as if it were an enlarged, extended, silent, or still spell. These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such as those provided by _[haste]_ or a _[speed]_ weapon, nor do they actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round. _Blessing of fervor _does not stack with _[haste]_.

## Mythic Blessing of Fervor

Affected creatures can choose two of the spells bonuses each round rather than one.
