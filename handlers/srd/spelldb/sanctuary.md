# Spell: Sanctuary

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-sanctuary] pg. 336 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-sanctuary])

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric/oracle 1, inquisitor 1, warpriest 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** creature touched  

**Duration** 1 round/level  

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.

## Mythic Sanctuary

If an attacker succeeds at its Will save to attack the protected target, add your tier to the targets AC against the attack. If the target uses a healing spell or ability on another creature, that creature gains the benefit of non-mythic _[sanctuary]_ for 1 round. If the creature breaks the non-mythic _[sanctuary]_ by attacking, subsequent healing by the target doesnt create another non-mythic _[sanctuary]_ effect on the creature.   

**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, select a number of additional creatures equal to half your tier that are within reach. These creatures gain the benefit of non-mythic _[sanctuary]_.
