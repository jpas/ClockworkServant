### Description

You alter the targets voice to something else. For example, you could make the targets voice high-pitched, husky, or nasal, or change its accent to an accent you are familiar with. If this spell is used as part of a disguise, the target gets a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when trying to fool a listener.  

The target can vary the disguised voice just as it could its normal voice. For example, a halfling female given a male dwarf nobles voice and accent could speak in falsetto, with a rural halfling accent, and so on.
