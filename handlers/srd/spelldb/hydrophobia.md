Targets in the area must succeed at a Will save or become deathly afraid of drowning. If the target is swimming or otherwise submerged in water, it must spend all of its efforts attempting to escape from the water.

Even out of water, targets cannot imbibe potions or willingly interact with any fluids for the duration of this spell.
