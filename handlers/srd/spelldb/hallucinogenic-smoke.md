^([Faiths and Philosophies][ss-hallucinogenic-smoke] pg. 28 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-hallucinogenic-smoke])

**School** conjuration [poison]; **Level** cleric/oracle 4, warpriest 4, witch 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** S, M (tobacco leaves, ingested)

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 3 rounds/level or until discharged; see text  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

Dark gray smoke seeps from your eyes, ears, and mouth for the spells duration, though the smoke doesnt significantly hamper your vision. Upon casting the spell, you may immediately exhale the smoke in a 30-foot cone or do so in a later round as a standard action, ending the spell. Each living creature caught within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round per caster level as it is wracked with waves of nausea and disorienting visions. If it succeeds at its Fortitude save, the creature is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds.  

If you dont expel the smoke by the end of the spells duration, you suffer the spells effects instead.  

If you cast _[augury]_ during the duration of _[hallucinogenic smoke]_, treat your caster level as 5 higher when determining the chance for a meaningful reply. Additionally, you know whether a result of nothing resulted from a failed or successful _[augury]_.
