^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-false-life] pg. 280 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-false-life])

**School** necromancy; **Level** alchemist 2, arcanist 2, bloodrager 2, investigator 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of blood)

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until discharged; see text

### Description

You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).

## Mythic False Life

The temporary hit points gained increase to 2d8 + 2 per caster level (maximum +20). As an immediate action, you can dismiss the remaining duration of the spell to prevent 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage per 10 temporary hit points remaining from the spell. This takes effect after the attack hits you and the damage is rolled, but before you take the damage. For example, if you have 22 temporary hit points from _[mythic false life]_ and a wyvern stings you for 3 points of Constitution damage, you can dismiss the spell to prevent 2 points of Constitution damage from that attack.
