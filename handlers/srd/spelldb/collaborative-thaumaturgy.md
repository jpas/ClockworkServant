You tap into the magical resonance between you and your allies to enhance one anothers magic. Cast this spell when an ally casts a spell at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast.

If the ally is the target of two _[collaborative thaumaturgy]_ spells when casting a spell, the ally can instead apply the Empower Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. Finally, if the ally is the target of three _[collaborative thaumaturgy]_ spells when casting a spell, she can instead apply the Maximize Spell or Widen Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 3 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. You cant target yourself with _[collaborative thaumaturgy]_.
