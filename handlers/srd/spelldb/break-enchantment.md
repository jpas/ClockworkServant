**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

### Description

This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. _Break enchantment_ can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.  

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by _[dispel magic]_, _[break enchantment]_ works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.  

If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, _[break enchantment]_ does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.

## Mythic Break Enchantment

Against non-mythic effects, the spell automatically succeeds without requiring a caster level check. Against mythic effects, add your tier to your caster level check. The maximum level of spell this spell can remove is 5 + half your tier.  

**Augmented (7th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can apply a removed enchantment, transmutation, or curse to the creature that originally cast it. The creature must be a valid target of the spell and on the same plane as you, and it gets a saving throw at the effects original DC.
