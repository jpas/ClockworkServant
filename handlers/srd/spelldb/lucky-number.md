### Description

You are able to tweak tiny variables affecting a creatures immediate future in order to grant the target a bit of luck at the right time. Roll a d20; once during the duration of _[lucky number]_, when the target creature rolls that result (regardless of what type of dice the target rolls), the creature has the option to either reroll the result or add a +2 luck bonus to the result. The creature must decide to use this ability before the success or failure of the original roll is known. A creature can have only one lucky number at a time. If lucky number is cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new number replaces the previous one.
