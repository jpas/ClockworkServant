### Description

_Prismatic wall_ creates a vertical, opaque walla shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded by the colors for 2d4 rounds if it looks at the wall.  

The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A _[prismatic wall]_ spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.  

Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.  

The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A _[rod of cancellation]_ or a _mage's disjunction_mage's disjunction spell destroys a _[prismatic wall]_, but an _[antimagic field]_ fails to penetrate it. _Dispel magic_ and _[greater dispel magic]_ can only be used on the wall once all the other colors have been destroyed. Spell resistance is effective against a _[prismatic wall]_, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.  

_Prismatic wall_ can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_ spell.  

**Order**| **Color**| **Effect of Color**| **Negated By**  
---|---|---|---  
1st| Red| Stops nonmagical ranged weapons. Deals 20 points of fire damage (Reflex half).| _Cone of cold_  
2nd| Orange| Stops magical ranged weapons. Deals 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half).| _Gust of wind_  
3rd| Yellow| Stops poisons, gases, and petrification. Deals 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half).| _Disintegrate_  
4th| Green| Stops breath weapons. Poison (frequency: 1/rd for 6 rd.; init. effect: death, sec. effect: 1 Con/rd.; cure 2 consecutive Fort saves).| _Passwall_  
5th| Blue| Stops divination and mental attacks. Turned to stone (Fortitude negates).| _Magic missile_  
6th| Indigo| Stops all spells. Will save or become insane (as _insanity_ spell).| _Daylight_  
7th| Violet| Energy field destroys all objects and effects.^* Creatures sent to another plane (Will negates).| _Dispel magic_ or _greater dispel magic_  

^* The violet effect makes the special effects of the other six colors redundant, but these six effects are included here because certain magic items can create prismatic effects one color at a time, and spell resistance might render some colors ineffective (see above).
