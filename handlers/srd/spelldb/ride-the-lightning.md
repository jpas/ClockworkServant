^([Ultimate Magic][ss-ride-the-lightning] pg. **LOOKUP** | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-ride-the-lightning])

**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** arcanist 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 swift action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

### Description

You may transform into lightning as a standard action and instantly travel in a straight line to a distance of up to 120 feet, rematerializing in the new location as a free action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures in this line take 10d6 points of electrical damage and are staggered for 1 round (a successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition, spell resistance applies). Objects in your path are damaged as well, with combustible objects being set ablaze and metals with low melting points melted. If your path is interrupted by a barrier or otherwise deflected, you materialize short of your final destination in the nearest open space; targets in the line to that point take damage as normal. You are immune to electricity while this spell lasts.
