^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-stone-shape] pg. 349 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-stone-shape])

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M/DF (soft clay)

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** stone or stone object touched, up to 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with _[stone shape]_, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.

## Mythic Stone Shape

The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous (see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when the spell ends).
