### Description

You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.  

_1st Round_: Presence or absence of secret doors.  

_2nd Round_: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.  

_Each Additional Round_: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
