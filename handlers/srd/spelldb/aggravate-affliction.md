# Spell: Aggravate Affliction

^([Pathfinder #82: Secrets of the Sphinx][ss-aggravate-affliction] pg. 75 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-aggravate-affliction])

**School** necromancy; **Level** arcanist 4, cleric/oracle 3, druid 3, hunter 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, warpriest 3, witch 3

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** one creature  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

All recurring afflictions (those with a frequency,including curses, diseases, and poison) possessed by the targeted creature immediately trigger, requiring an immediate saving throw (as described in the affliction) to avoid suffering their effects. A successful saving throw does not count toward ending the affliction, and this extra save does not change the timing of the next save against the affliction. Afflictions without a frequency are unaffected by this spell.
