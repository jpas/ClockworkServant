# Spell: Recoil Fire

^([Ultimate Combat][ss-recoil-fire] pg. **LOOKUP** | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-recoil-fire])

**School** transmutation; **Level** arcanist 2, red mantis assassin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (hoof shavings from a mule)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** 1 firearm  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

### Description

The target firearm suddenly fires of its own volition, even if it is unloaded, generating a recoil so great that the wielder or carrier of the firearm must scramble to hold onto it and becomes flat-footed until the start of his next turn. If the wielder is already flat-footed, he is instead knocked prone. If the firearm was loaded, that ammunition is wasted.
