^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-stoneskin] pg. 350 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-stoneskin])

**School** abjuration; **Level** adept 4, alchemist 4, arcanist 4, bloodrager 4, druid 5, hunter 5, inquisitor 4, investigator 4, magus 4, shaman 5, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 3

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (granite and diamond dust worth 250 gp)

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** creature touched  

**Duration** 10 min./level or until discharged  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

### Description

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains DR 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

## Mythic Stoneskin

The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease, poison, and stun effects. There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against the target is treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing _[medium fortification]_ armor.
