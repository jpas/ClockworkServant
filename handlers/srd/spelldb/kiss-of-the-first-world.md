### Description

This spella favorite of fey spellcastersis traditionally bestowed with a kiss, though all thats really required to gift someone with a _kiss of the First World _is a touch. This spell infuses a living creature with a surge of positive energy from the First World, filling the target with the raw energies of life. The exact effects of this spell vary, depending on the nature of the creature touched. Constructs are immune to the effects of this spell.  

_Living Creature_: A living creature gains a 20-foot increase to his base land speed and a +2 insight bonus on all Charismabased skill checks. In addition, the creature gains fast healing 2. Fire, acid, and negative energy cause this fast healing to stop functioning on the round following the attack.  

_Undead Creature_: An undead creature targeted by this spell is staggered for the duration of this spell. It does not gain the benefits of any channel resistance it might normally enjoy, and the save DCs for any of its special attacks (but not spell-like abilities or spells) are reduced by 2.
