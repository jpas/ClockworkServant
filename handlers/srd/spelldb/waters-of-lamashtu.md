### Description

This spell generates what appears to be clear, pure water, but is in fact a foul secretion known as the _waters of Lamashtu_. The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see _[curse water]_). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must make a Fortitude save (drinking the _waters of Lamashtu_ is particularly effectivecreatures who drink the stuff take a 4 penalty on their save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and drives the victim mad (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms the body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subjects Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the _waters of Lamashtu_, enough for one draft or use (if bottled) as a thrown weapon. The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the _waters of Lamashtu_ (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GMs whim (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).

## Mythic Waters of Lamashtu

When used as unholy water, _mythic waters of Lamashtu_ deal twice as much damage and prevent the creature from regaining hit points from fast healing or regeneration for 1d4 rounds (meaning the creature can be killed normally). The ability damage from the waters increases to 2d4, and a creature imbibing or anointed by the waters is nauseated for 1d4 rounds if it fails its saving throw. The long-term effects of drinking _mythic waters of Lamashtu_ happen more quickly, requiring only regular exposure over weeks instead of massive quantities for months, and warp the consuming creature more extensively (at the GMs discretion). Monstrosities created by _mythic waters of Lamashtu_ can breed with members of their original species and pass on such mutations to their offspring.
