# Spell: Binding Earth

^([Advanced Race Guide][ss-binding-earth] pg. **LOOKUP** | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-binding-earth])

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 2, hunter 2, witch 2 (oread)

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** one creature or unattended object (see text)  

**Duration** 1 round/level  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

If the target of this spell fails its Fortitude save, areas of earth and stone floor act as a snapping quagmire that pulls the target down and damages it if it attempts to move through such terrain.  

If the target is a creature, it treats all areas of earth and stone it moves through as difficult terrain. Furthermore, for each 5 feet a creature moves through such areas, it takes 1d6 points of damage. Creatures with a burrow speed or the earth glide ability are unaffected by _[binding earth]_.  

If cast on an unattended object resting on an area of stone or earth, the stone or earth warps and wraps around it, pulling it firmly to the ground. A DC 15 Strength check is required to pull the object free from snapping earth or stone.
