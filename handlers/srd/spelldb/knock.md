### Description

_Knock_ opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to _[hold portal]_ or _[arcane lock]_. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, _[knock]_ opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an _[arcane locked]_ door, the spell does not remove the _[arcane lock]_ but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. _Knock_ does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.

## Mythic Knock

The spell unlocks up to three means of closure instead of two. The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so). If used on a door locked with _[arcane lock]_, you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted _[dispel magic]_, adding your tier to the check.   

**Augmented (3rd)**: You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an _[arcane lock]_ on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed).  

If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesnt automatically open.  

The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.
