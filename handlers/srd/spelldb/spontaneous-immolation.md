^([Ultimate Combat][ss-spontaneous-immolation] pg. **LOOKUP** | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-spontaneous-immolation])

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** arcanist 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (pinch of saltpeter)

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  

**Target** one creature  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude half and Reflex (see description); **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You point your finger at a creature, causing it to spontaneously burst into flame. The target takes 3d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire. A successful Fortitude save reduces this damage by half and prevents the target from catching on fire. Each round on your turn, a burning target can attempt a new save to extinguish the flames (DC equal to the DC of the spell); otherwise it takes another 1d6 fire damage.
