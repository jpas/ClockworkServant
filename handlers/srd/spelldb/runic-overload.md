### Description

This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on a creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a runescarred creature (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Cities of Golarion_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Cities of Golarion 60), it deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the target and stuns the target for 1 round. When the spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the targets spell resistance. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.  

The spell can also be cast on other magical runes, such as those from _[arcane mark]_ or _[explosive runes]_. In this case, the resulting explosion deals 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8) to all creatures within a 5-foot radius. Creatures in the area that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage. This spell doesnt destroy runes; targeted runes continue to function normally. Mundane runes, such as ones in writing or runic tattoos, cannot be affected by this spell.
