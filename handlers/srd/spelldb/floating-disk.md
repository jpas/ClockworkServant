^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-floating-disk] pg. 284 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-floating-disk])

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** arcanist 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Effect** 3-ft.-diameter disk of force  

**Duration** 1 hour/level  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.

## Mythic Floating Disk

The disk created by this spell lasts for 2 hours per caster level and can carry up to 200 pounds of weight per caster level.   

The disk accompanies you regardless of your speed, always catching up no matter how far you move. If you stand or sit on the disk, as a move action you can direct it to travel up to 30 feet in any direction.  

Any objects resting on the disk count as weightless parts of your gear for the purpose of teleportation effects (allowing these items to go with you when you teleport despite the weight limit of the _[teleportation]_ spell).   

As a free action, you can transform the plane of force from a concave disk into a bucket-like shape that holds up to 4 gallons (or transform it from the bucket-like form back to its normal disk form).
