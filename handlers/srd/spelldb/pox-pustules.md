# Spell: Pox Pustules

^([Advanced Player's Guide][ss-pox-pustules] pg. 236 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-pox-pustules])

**School** necromancy [disease]; **Level** druid 2, hunter 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (leaves from a toxic plant)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target is sickened and takes a 4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.

## Mythic Pox Pustules

The Dexterity penalty increases to 6. The target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1. If the bleeding is stopped, scratching causes it to start again at 1 point of bleed per round.
