### Description

You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the targets speed. The target also takes a 4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a 1 penalty on attack rolls, the second 2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of 5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at 1.   

This spell fails if cast on a flying creature.
