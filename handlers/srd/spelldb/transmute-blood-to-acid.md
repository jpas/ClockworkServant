^([Ultimate Magic][ss-transmute-blood-to-acid] pg. **LOOKUP** | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-transmute-blood-to-acid])

**School** transmutation [acid, pain]; **Level** arcanist 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a wax doll and a vial of acid worth 10 gp)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** one living creature  

**Duration** concentration (maximum 1 round/5 levels)  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude half; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You transmute blood in the targets body to acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round. The creature is staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved creatures equipment is unaffected.  

Anyone who strikes the target with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of acid damage as the acidic blood sprays on the attacker. If the attack is from a piercing or slashing manufactured weapon, the weapon also takes this damage.  

This spell has no effect on creatures immune to critical hits or bleed effects.
