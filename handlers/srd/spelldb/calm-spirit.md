### Description

This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead such as ghosts and poltergeists. You have no control over the affected creatures, but _[calm spirit]_ postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect.  

Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check equal to at least 10 + the haunts CR in order to temporarily calm the angry entity. The spells duration decreases to concentration (up to 1 round/level), when affecting a haunt.
