Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a 7 penalty on its next saving throw.A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a _[limited wish]_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).

## Mythic Limited Wish

When using _[mythic limited wish]_ to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if youre a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if youre a caster who prepares spells). If you dont know or havent prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.  

**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled _[mythic limited wish]_, even if youre helpless or couldnt otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
