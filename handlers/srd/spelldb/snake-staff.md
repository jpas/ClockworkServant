### Description

With a long hissing whisper, you transform ordinary pieces of wood into various sorts of snakes that immediately attack your foes. As long as the snakes remain within sight, you can direct their actions telepathically as a free action. You can only apply this spell to wooden objects not in a creatures possession or not part of a larger structure or plant. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below. See Snake statistics and advanced and giant simple templates.

_Venomous Snake_: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 1 snake.

_Constrictor Snake_: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 2 snakes.

_Advanced Venomous Snake_: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 2 snakes.

_Advanced Constrictor Snake_: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 3 snakes.

_Advanced Giant Venomous Snake_: A log or pile of debris. Counts as 4 snakes.

_Advanced Giant Constrictor Snake_: A fallen tree or a large pile of debris. Counts as 5 snakes.
