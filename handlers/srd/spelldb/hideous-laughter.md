### Description

This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration.  

A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't translate well.

## Mythic Hideous Laughter

A creature of a type different than your own doesnt gain a bonus on its saving throws against this spell. The affected target laughs so hard it hurts, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round it spends laughing.  

If the target fails its initial save, it must succeed at two follow-up saving throws (each a full-round action that doesnt provoke attacks of opportunity) to end the spell. Succeeding at only one save means the spell no longer deals damage, but the target is still unable to take actions.   

**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the targets laughter becomes contagious. When the targets allies are within 30 feet and can hear the laugh, they must successfully save against the spell or be sickened until the target stops laughing. The sickened effect ends if the ally moves more than 30 feet from the target or is unable to hear the targets laughter for an entire round.
