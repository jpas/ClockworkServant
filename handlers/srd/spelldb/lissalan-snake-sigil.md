### Description

There are seven variants of this spell, one for each of the Thassilonian schools of magic.

This effect lasts for 1 day/level. This is a curse effect that can be removed via _[remove curse]_.

_Enchantment_: The target takes a 1d6 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This is a compulsion effect.  

_Evocation_: The target gains vulnerability to an energy type, chosen randomly from the following: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This is an acid, cold, electricity, or fire effect.  

_Illusion_: The targets vision is blurred, giving it a 4 penalty on Perception checks relating to vision, and the target treats all other creatures as having _[displacement]_. This is a glamer effect.  

_Necromancy_: The target is exhausted. This condition cannot be removed with rest.  

_Transmutation_: Target is affected by _[slow]_.
