Upon completing this spell, roll a single d20 and record the result.

This spell cannot be used to replace a roll that has already been made; the recorded result must be used instead of a roll. Once you have used this recorded result or the duration of the spell ends, the spells effect ends. You cant have more than one instance of embrace destiny active on you at the same time.
