^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-regenerate] pg. 331 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-regenerate])

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric/oracle 7, druid 9, shaman 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** 3 full rounds  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** living creature touched  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

### Description

The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.  

_Regenerate_ also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).

## Mythic Regenerate

The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a vorpal weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as _[breath of life]_), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.
