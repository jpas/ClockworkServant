**Target** creature touched  

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

### Description

You gain the ability to see through solid rock as if it were transparent glass. You may see through 1 foot of stone per caster level. You see within the stone as if you were looking at the area in normal light, even if there is no illumination, though low-light vision and darkvision have no effect on your ability to see through stone. Metal at least 1 inch thick or wood or dirt at least 3 feet thick blocks your vision.  

The spell does not negate concealment for those creatures hiding behind stone objects (the stone is still an obstacle to your attacks).
