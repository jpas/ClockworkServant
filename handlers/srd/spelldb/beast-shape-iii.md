## Mythic Beast Shape III

Each _[mythic beast shape]_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _[beast shape]_ spell to learn its mythic version. You dont have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level _[mythic beast shape]_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic beast shape II_ if you know _beast shape II_, even if you dont know _mythic beast shape I_). Each _[mythic beast shape]_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  

The spells bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum 4).   

**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if youre 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of _[mythic beast shape]_.
