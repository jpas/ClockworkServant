### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)  

**Saving Throw** none and Will negates (see text); **Spell Resistance** no and yes (see text)

### Description

You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a 2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarians rage, bloodragers bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, rage spell, skalds inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt at a Will saving throw, without the rage effects bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).  

If you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your rage effect comes from a skalds raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot re-accept the effects of the song.
