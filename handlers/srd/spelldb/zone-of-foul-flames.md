### Description

The twisted druids of the Uskwood forsook fire in ages past for the glory of Zon-Kuthon. Despite this aversion, these servants of Nidal know well the sting of flame, and have learned to turn it back on those that wield it. This spell creates a zone where magical fire effects twist and lash out against those who create the effects. A _[zone of foul flames]_ looks unremarkable to the casual observer, but a Perception check (DC = 20 + the casters level) reveals a faint rippling effect in the area, as if of heat distortions in the air.  

Whenever a creature casts a spell with the fire descriptor or activates a magical fire effect (as from a magic item or a special attack) while that creature is located in a _[zone of foul flames]_, that creature takes full fire damage from the effect. If the effect allows a saving throw to reduce the damage, the victim may attempt the same saving throw to reduce the damage. All creatures in a _[zone of foul flames]_ gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against fire effects, except for those made by a creature attempting to save against fire damage from his own magic. Nonmagical fire in a _[zone of foul flames]_ burns half as brightly but is otherwise not affected.
