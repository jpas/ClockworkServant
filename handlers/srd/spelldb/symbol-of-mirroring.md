### Description

This spell functions as _[symbol of death]_, except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as _[mirror image]_, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creatures turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  

_Symbol of mirroring _can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_ spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.
