### Description

You unleash the power of zealous conviction to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a burst of metallic, pulsing energy. Only creatures with a neutral alignment component are harmed by the spell; chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good creatures are unaffected.  

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) to neutral creatures (with the exception of neutral outsiders, who take 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6). Neutral outsiders are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the nauseated effect.  

The spell deals half damage against creatures that are chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good, and they are not nauseated. With a successful Will save, the damage is reduced by half again (down to one-quarter).
