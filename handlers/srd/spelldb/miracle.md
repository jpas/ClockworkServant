### Description

You don't so much cast a _[miracle]_ as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.  

A _[miracle]_ can do any of the following things.

* Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.

* Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.

* Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_ or _insanity_.

* Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

* Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.

Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.

* Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.

Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.

* Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_ or _insanity_.

Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _[feeblemind]_ or _[insanity]_.

* Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a _[miracle]_ costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful _[miracles]_ of this sort could include the following:

* Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.

* Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.

* Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.

* Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.

* Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.

Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.  

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a _[miracle]_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
