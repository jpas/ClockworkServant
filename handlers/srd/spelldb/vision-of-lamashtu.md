### Description

This spell functions exactly as the spell _[nightmare]_. In addition to the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered when the target wakes at the _[nightmare]_s conclusion. You must have this second spell prepared, and it must be cast immediately after _vision of Lamashtu_ (effectively adding the two spells casting times). This second spell rides along with the _[nightmare]_, affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can be sent along with the nightmare, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects one target (which is always the _[nightmare]_s recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spells range is irrelevant for the purposes of _vision of Lamashtu_, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victims _[nightmare]_). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send _[bestow curse]_ along as part of a _vision of Lamashtu_, but not _[blade barrier]_ (affects an area), _[destruction]_ (too high level), or _[inflict moderate wounds]_ (deals hit point damage).
