### Description

This spell functions as _[sea steed]_, but as long as you are mounted on the affected creature, you also gain the amphibious quality and your melee attacks function as if you were using _[freedom of movement]_. If you are dismounted, you retain the amphibious quality for 1 minute; if you remount before this time, the spell continues. If not, your mount retains the effects but you do not. If your mount is dropped to 0 or fewer hit points, the spell ends for both of you.
