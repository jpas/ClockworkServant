### Description

You inscribe a series of runes upon the surface of a door or around the border of an entryway. They function as a _[glyph of warding]_ (blast glyph), though unlike a _[glyph of warding]_, these runes are always visible. The runes count as a _[glyph of warding]_ for the purpose of what spells can defeat it, placing multiple glyphs in the same area, and so on.
