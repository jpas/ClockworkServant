**Target** one metal item of up to 1 sq. ft.  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** yes (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

### Description

You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a mirror. This does not prevent the item from later damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface. The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail.
