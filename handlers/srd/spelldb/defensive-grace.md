# Spell: Defensive Grace

^([Advanced Class Origins][ss-defensive-grace] pg. 31 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-defensive-grace])

**School** transmutation; **Level** investigator 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a living fly)

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 round/level (D; see below)

### Description

Each round you can roll an inspiration die without expending a use of inspiration and gain the result as a dodge bonus to AC for that round. You are immune to precision damage (including the extra damage from the precise strike deed, sneak attack, studied combat, and studied strike).  

If a critical hit is confirmed against you, you can dismiss this spell as an immediate action to negate the critical and make the attack instead deal normal damage.
