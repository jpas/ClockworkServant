### Description

Laying a hand upon an allied creatures jaw, claws, tentacles, or other natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creatures natural attacks. Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is. If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creatures size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.
