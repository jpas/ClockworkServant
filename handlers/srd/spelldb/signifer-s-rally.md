^([Cheliax, Empire of Devils][ss-signifer-s-rally] pg. 23 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-signifer-s-rally])

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (100 gp worth of bloodstone for every ally teleported)

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  

**Target** one willing ally/5 levels  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

### Description

You teleport up to one ally per five caster levels to your location. You determine which allies you want to teleport at the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse your spell, and they teleport immediately upon accepting. Allies are teleported as if you had cast _[teleport]_ on them (your current location is at least studied carefully for this purpose), appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures (such as a _[magic circle against evil]_ effect).
