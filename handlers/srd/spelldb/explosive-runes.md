### Description

You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The _[explosive runes]_ detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the _[explosive runes]_ (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the _[explosive runes]_ is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the _[explosive runes]_ were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).  

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the _[explosive runes]_. Likewise, you can remove the _[explosive runes]_ whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful _[dispel magic]_ or _[erase]_ spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the _[explosive runes]_ and failing to do so triggers the explosion.  

Magic traps such as _[explosive runes]_ are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart _[explosive runes]_. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for _[explosive runes]_.
