### Description

The _[black spot]_ is a specific and feared pirate curse. An intangible, illusory black spot manifests above the targets head and remains until the target dies or the curse is lifted. The _[black spot]_ cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other illusions.  

The_[ black spot]_ radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target has a 4 penalty on saving throws against death effects.  

Every day in which a creature bears a _[black spot]_, it must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage. The damage cannot be healed until the _[black spot]_ is removed. If the creatures Constitution reaches 0, it dies. Pirates killed by this spell often return as ghosts, but that is not a direct effect of this spell.  

The_[ black spot]_ cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with _[break enchantment]_, _[limited wish]_, _[miracle]_, _[remove curse]_, or _[wish]_.
