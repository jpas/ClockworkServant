### Description

Bristles burst from your body, lodging in your opponent and blossoming into entangling vines as you pummel your target. While this spell is in effect, your natural attacks and unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of damage, and any creature hit by your natural or unarmed strike must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for the duration of the spell. A creature entangled by this spell can spend a standard action to remove the vines but can be entangled again by further unarmed strikes.
