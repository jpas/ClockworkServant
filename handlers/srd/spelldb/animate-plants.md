# Spell: Animate Plants

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-animate-plants] pg. 242 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-animate-plants])

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 7, shaman 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Targets** one Large plant per three caster levels or all plants within range; see text  

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may animate one Large or smaller plant, or a number of larger plants as follows: a Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.  

Use the statistics for animated objects, except that plants smaller than Large don't have hardness.  

_Animate plants_ cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.  

_Entangle_: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an _[entangle]_ spell. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled. This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.

## Mythic Animate Plants

Animated plants you create with this spell get the maximum number of hit points per level, gain a +4 bonus to their Strength ability scores, and have 11/2 times the normal number of construction points.
