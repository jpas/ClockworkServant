### Description

You can detect other worshipers of your deity (mortal worshipers, outsider servants, and so on). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you focus on a particular area or subject.  

_1st Round_: Presence or absence of the faithful.  

_2nd Round_: Number of individual faithful in the area.  

_3rd Round_: The exact location of each worshiper. If a fellow worshiper is outside your line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact location.  

Each round you can rotate to detect worshipers in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.  

The GM decides if worshipers are present. A creatures personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as youhence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. The Green Faith counts as a deity for the purpose of this spell.
