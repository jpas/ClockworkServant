### Description

This spell allows you to turn a potion into a temporary pool of necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if _[detect magic]_ is cast on it while it remains under this spells effects.  

When you drink a potion affected by this spell, you do not gain the potions normal effect. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that _[deathwine]_ affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks _[deathwine]_ made from a _[potion of cure serious wounds]_ would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as _[cure serious wounds]_ is a 3rd-level spell.  

In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) that drinks a potion affected by _[deathwine]_ is healed of 1d8 points of damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spells duration expires is destroyed at the end of the _[deathwines]_ duration.
