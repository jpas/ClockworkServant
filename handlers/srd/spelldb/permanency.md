### Description

This spell makes the duration of certain other spells permanent. You first cast the desired spell and then follow it with the _[permanency]_ spell.  

Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level and must expend a specific gp value of diamond dust as a material component.  

You can make the following spells permanent in regard to yourself.  

**Spell**| **Minimum Caster Level**| **GP Cost**

You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of _[permanency]_ can be dispelled only by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.  

In addition to personal use, _[permanency]_ can be used to make the following spells permanent on yourself, another creature, or an object (as appropriate).
