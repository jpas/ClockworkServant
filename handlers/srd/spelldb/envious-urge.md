You fill creatures with feelings of seething envy. Affected targets turn upon the nearest creature (whether an ally or enemy) and attempt to disarm it of a valuable weapon, steal something it is holding, or grapple it and strip it of something it prizes (your choice). Affected targets can attempt a new Will save each round as a free action to end this effect.
