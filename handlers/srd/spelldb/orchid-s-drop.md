### Description

Alchemists have tried for centuries to recreate Artokus Kirrans feat of genius that created the _[sun orchid elixir]_. Although they have yet to unlock the elixirs exact formula, their efforts have not been entirely wasted. One by-product of their experiments was the _[orchids drop]_ formula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemists mutagen into a potent healing tonic.  

As long as youre under the effects of _[orchids drop]_, drinking a dose of your mutagen heals you of 2d10 points of damage. For the spells duration, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws.
