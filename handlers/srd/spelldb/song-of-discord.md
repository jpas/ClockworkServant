# Spell: Song of Discord

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-song-of-discord] pg. 345 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-song-of-discord])

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; **Level** bard 5, skald 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  

**Area** creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread  

**Duration** 1 round/level  

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a _[song of discord]_ to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.
