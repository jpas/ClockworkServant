### Description

This spell functions as _[interposing hand]_, except that it can also grapple one opponent as _[grasping hand]_. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A _[crushing hand]_ deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The _[crushing hand]_ can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as _[forceful hand]_), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as _[interposing hand]_ does.
