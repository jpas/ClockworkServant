### Description

You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The _[shifting sand]_ obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the _[shifting sand]_ must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.

As a move action, you may move the area of _[shifting sand]_ up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spells area are carried along with the _[shifting sand]_ in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the _[shifting sand]_.
