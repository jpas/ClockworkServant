### Description

This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a _[wall of force]_. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the _[wall of force]_ first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.  

When scribing a _[symbol of sealing]_, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the _[symbol of sealing]_, but doing this extends the casting time as described under _[symbol of death]_. However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attunedthe password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.  

A _[disintegrate]_ spell or similar effect can destroy the _[wall of force]_ created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A _[knock]_ spell has no effect on a _[symbol of sealing]_ or its force wall. A _[symbol of sealing]_ cannot be dispelled, but _[mages disjunction]_ automatically destroys it.
