### Description

The spell allows you channel fire into your very being. If you dont already have the fire subtype, this spell grants you the fire subtype. If you already have the fire subtype, you instead channel the flames from your being outward, creating a 10-foot-radius aura of fire centered on you. Creatures who enter or end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d8 points of fire damage.  

Multiple castings of this spell stack; you can cast it once on yourself to gain the fire subtype, then again to manifest the aura of flames around you.
