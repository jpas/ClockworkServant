### Description

This spell functions as _[polymorph]_ except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as _beast shape IV_. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as _elemental body III_. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as _[alter self]_. If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as _plant shape II_. If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as _form of the dragon I_. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.
