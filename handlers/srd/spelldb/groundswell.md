### Description

This spell allows the target to cause the ground to rise up beneath him. As a swift action, the target can cause the ground to rise 5 feet, while all adjacent squares are treated as steep slopes. The _[groundswell]_ precludes flanking from creatures standing at lower elevations than the target. If the target moves after creating a _[groundswell]_, the ground returns to its normal elevation at the end of his turn; otherwise, it remains in place until the target moves or uses a swift action to return the ground to normal. A _[groundswell]_ cannot increase elevation of the ground beyond 5 feet.
