### Description

Upon casting this spell, the recipient is empowered to see up to 60 feet through thick plant matter as though it were transparent. Leaves, vines, and greeneryeven moss, lichen, and slime offer no concealment to the recipients sight, though her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, as if from trees or wooden structures. Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature against a recipient of the effects of _[greensight]_.
