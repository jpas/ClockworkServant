^([Advanced Class Guide][ss-adhesive-spittle] pg. 172 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-adhesive-spittle])

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** alchemist 1, arcanist 1, investigator 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** 15 ft.  

**Target** one creature  

**Duration** 1 round/level or until discharged (see text)  

**Saving Throw** Reflex partial; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description

Once during this spells duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spells DC rather than a tanglefoot bags normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.
