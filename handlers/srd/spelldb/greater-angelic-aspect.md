### Description

This spell functions like_[ lesser angelic aspect]_, except you gain lowlight vision; darkvision 60 feet; DR 10/evil; immunity to acid, cold, and petrification; resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10; a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison; and protective aura and truespeech as supernatural abilities for the duration of the spell. Also, your wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.  

Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise, it functions as a _[magic circle against evil]_ and a _[lesser globe of invulnerability]_, both with a radius of 20 feet.  

Truespeech allows you to speak with any creature that has a language, as though using the _[tongues]_ spell.
