**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, F (a small prism)

### Description

You can focus upon a single point within line of sight and discern if the terrain or geographic features of that point are illusory. This ability allows you a Will save to disbelieve a terrain-affecting illusion (glamer) effect from range as though you had interacted with it. In addition to affecting such spells as _[hallucinatory terrain]_ and _[mirage arcana]_, this spell also allows you to disbelieve naturally occurring mirages.
