### Description

This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).  

Unlike other spells that heal damage, _[breath of life]_ can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through _[breath of life]_ gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day.  

Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by breath of life.  

Like cure spells, _[breath of life]_ deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.

## Mythic Breath of Life

The spell heals 5d12 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). It can revive a creature that died of hp damage within the past 2 rounds. If the target was slain by a death effect that allows a saving throw, this spell allows the creature to attempt another save against that effect. If this save is successful, the creature is revived with 10 hp plus the amount healed by this spell.  

**Augmented (9th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can target up to one creature per caster level within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can target one creature that has been dead for a number of rounds up to your caster level.
