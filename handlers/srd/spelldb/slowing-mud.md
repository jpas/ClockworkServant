# Spell: Slowing Mud

^([Advanced Class Guide][ss-slowing-mud] pg. 192 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-slowing-mud])

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** druid 4, hunter 4, shaman 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (earth and water)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  

**Duration** 1 round/level (see text)  

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a _[slow]_ spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as _[create water]_ or _[hydraulic push]_) removes all the mud in 1 round.  

A _[haste]_ effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the _[haste]_. Slow does not stack with the effects of _[slowing mud]_. This spell cannot counter or dispel _[haste]_.
