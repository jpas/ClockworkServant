### Description

This spell was created by the paladins of the Mendevian Crusades, and co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.  

When you cast this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting the weapon the bane weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 roundsthe outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

## Mythic Crusader's Edge

Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points. While wielding this weapon, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities originating from evil outsiders.  

**Augmented (5th)**: You can expend two uses of mythic power to give the touched weapon the _[holy]_ weapon special ability.
