### Description

A creature protected by _[endure elements]_ suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between 50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected.  

_Endure elements_ doesn't provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.

## Mythic Endure Elements

The target changes to one creature touched per level. Affected creatures gain cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5. Theyre not slowed by snow, and ignore penalties on Perception checks and ranged weapon attacks from hail, rain, sleet, and snow. They treat wind as one category weaker.
