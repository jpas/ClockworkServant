### Description

You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the marks exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The _[black mark]_ functions as a _[mark of justice]_, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the _[black mark]_ is active, the target is affected as if subject to _[natures exile]_, but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.

## Mythic Black Mark

Any time the cursed creature travels on or in the water more than 1 mile from shore, each day it (or the vessel its on) is attacked by one or more aquatic or water monsters, as if summoned by _summon natures ally VII_ (caster level 13th).
