^([Monster Codex][ss-ice-slick] pg. 69 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-ice-slick])

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** arcanist 2, druid 2, hunter 2, magus 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Area** 5-ft.-radius burst  

**Duration** instantaneous (see text)

### Description

You create a blast of intense cold, coating all solid surfaces in the area with a thin coating of ice. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and dont fall prone. Spell resistance applies to this initial effect.  

A creature can walk within or through the area of ice at half its normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure by 4 or less means the creature cant move that round (and must succeed at a Reflex save or fall); failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill on page 87 of the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to attempt this check.  

A 5-foot square of ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points. The ice is an instantaneous effect, but persists as nonmagical ice. Under temperate conditions, the ice lasts 1 minute per level. In tropical environments, it might last only half as long. In cold environments where ice and snow persist without melting, it could last indefinitely.
