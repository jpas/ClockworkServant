### Description

This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the _[maw of chaos]_ attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a _[maw of chaos]_, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur per round.  

Creatures dragged adjacent to the _[maw of chaos]_ become entangled by the frayed strands of reality being torn apart at the rim of the _[maw of chaos]_. Escape requires a successful Escape Artist check or grapple check against a DC equal to 10 plus the spells save DC. Every creature without the chaotic subtype that ends its turn adjacent to a _[maw of chaos]_ takes 2 points of damage to each ability score. Creatures with the lawful subtype take double this amount of damage; creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage.  

Calling, summoning, and teleportation effects used within 30 feet of the _[maw of chaos]_ or that cause a creature to appear within 30 feet of a _[maw of chaos]_ are redirected, causing the creature to arrive adjacent to the _[maw of chaos]_ rather than at its intended destination. Unattended objects (including dead bodies) adjacent to the _[maw of chaos]_ are drawn into it and affected as by _[disintegrate]_ at the beginning of the casters next turn.
