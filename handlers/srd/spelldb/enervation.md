^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-enervation] pg. 277 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-enervation])

**School** necromancy; **Level** arcanist 4, bloodrager 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Effect** ray of negative energy  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary negative levels (see Special Abilities). Negative levels stack.  

Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from _[enervation]_ don't last long enough to do so.  

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

## Mythic Enervation

The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, and the target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d6 5 temporary hit points for a number of hours equal to your caster level.   

**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any creature attempting to remove the targets negative levels must succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level + your tier).
