### Description

By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit from effects that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like the swashbucklers charmed life ability) or to choose the die result in lieu of rolling (like the wizards prescience school power or the cyclopss flash of insight ability). This doesnt affect abilities that force a creature to take the lower of two rolls, such as _[ill omen]_ or a pugwampis unluck aura (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 144). A cyclops cant use its flash of insight ability to save against this spell.
