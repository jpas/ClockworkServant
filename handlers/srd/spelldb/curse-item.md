^([Pathfinder #64: Beyond the Doomsday Door][ss-curse-item] pg. 73 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-curse-item])

**School** necromancy [curse]; **Level** cleric/oracle 2, warpriest 2 (Groetus)

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute  

**Components** V, S, DF

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** object touched  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

### Description

The object becomes flawed and prone to failure. The effects of this spell depend on the nature of the object.  

_Magic Item_: The item functions intermittently, gaining either an unreliable curse or a random dependent curse (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook _536).  

_Nonmagical Armor or Shield_: The item gains the fragile armor quality (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment _8).  

_Nonmagical Weapon_: The item gains the fragile weapon quality (_Ultimate Equipment _22).  

_Tool_: The item gains the broken condition if a creature rolls a natural 1 while making a skill check with the tool.  

_Other Item_: Each day it is used, the item has a 5% chance of gaining the broken condition.  

This spell does not affect artifacts. The item can be sold or discarded as normal (the bearer is not compelled to keep it). If a cleric of Groetus is using an item that is affected by this spell, he or she may make a DC 20 Will saving throw to override the items curse for 1 day (using it as if the item were not cursed).
