### Description

_Fire trap_ creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A _[fire trap]_ spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed.  

When casting _[fire trap]_, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.  

A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A _[knock]_ spell does not bypass a _[fire trap]_. An unsuccessful _[dispel magic]_ spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.  

You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.  

Magic traps such as _[fire trap]_ are hard to detect and disable. A character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a _[fire trap]_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's _[fire trap]_ or DC 29 for the arcane version).
