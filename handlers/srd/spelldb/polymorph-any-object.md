Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by this spell.  

This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.  

This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of _[baleful polymorph]_, _[greater polymorph]_, _[flesh to stone]_, _[stone to flesh]_, _[transmute mud to rock]_, _[transmute metal to wood]_, or _[transmute rock to mud]_.
