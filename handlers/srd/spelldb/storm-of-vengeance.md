# Spell: Storm of Vengeance

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-storm-of-vengeance] pg. 350 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-storm-of-vengeance])

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 9, druid 9, shaman 9, witch 9

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)  

**Effect** 360-ft.-radius storm cloud  

**Duration** concentration (maximum 10 rounds) (D)  

**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 10 minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.  

_2nd Round_: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save).  

_3rd Round_: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.  

_4th Round_: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).  

_5th through 10th Rounds_: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.  

Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the _[storm of vengeance]_'s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.

## Mythic Storm of Vengeance

The acid damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of acid damage. The lightning damage dealt increases to 10d8 points of electricity damage. You can call down a bolt of lightning on the 2nd and 4th rounds (equivalent to those on the 3rd round). You can strike the same target with a bolt more than once during the casting of the spell, but not more than once per round.   

**Augmented (7th)**: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the storm clouds radius increases to 1,000 feet. Structures in the storm take 1d10 points of damage per round (this damage bypasses hardness). You can call down one additional bolt in the 2nd and 4th rounds, and three additional bolts in the 3rd round.
