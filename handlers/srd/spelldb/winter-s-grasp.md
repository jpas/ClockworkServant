### Description

Ice encrusts the ground, radiating supernatural cold and making it difficult for creatures to maintain their balance. This icy ground is treated as normal ice, forcing creatures to spend 2 squares of movement to enter an icy square and increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks attempted in the area by 5. A creature that begins its turn in the affected area takes 1d6 points of cold damage, and takes a 2 penalty on saving throws against all spells with the cold descriptor for 1 round.
