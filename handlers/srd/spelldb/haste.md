### Description

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.  

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a _[speed]_ weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)  

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.  

All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple _[haste]_ effects don't stack. _Haste_ dispels and counters _[slow]_.

## Mythic Haste

Affected creatures gain an additional move action each round. The movement speed increase changes to 50 feet, to a maximum of three times the creatures normal speed for that movement type.   

**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the movement speed increase changes to 70 feet, with no limit based on the creatures normal speed. If an affected creature moves at least 30 feet on its turn, it can travel across liquid as if the liquid were solid. If the liquid deals damage on contact, the creature takes only half damage from moving across it.
