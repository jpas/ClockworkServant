## Mythic Dragon's Breath

The spells duration changes to 1 minute/level or until discharged. You can use the breath weapon up to three times during this duration. On the round you cast the spell, using the breath weapon is a free action; later uses require a standard action. You must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of the breath weapon. All uses for a particular casting have the same range, area, and energy type. You can have only one _[dragons breath]_ spell in effect at a time; casting a new one ends the previous one.
