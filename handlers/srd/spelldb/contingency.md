# Spell: Contingency

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-contingency] pg. 259 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-contingency])

**School** evocation; **Level** arcanist 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** at least 10 minutes; see text  

**Components** V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

### Description

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting _[contingency]_. The _[contingency]_ spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast _[contingency]_.  

The spell to be brought into effect by the _[contingency]_ must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).  

The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the _[contingency]_ immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being cast instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (_[contingency]_ and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.  

You can use only one _[contingency]_ spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

## Mythic Contingency

You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one _[contingency]_ spell upon it at a time unless it also knows _[mythic contingency]_. The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.  

**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of _[mythic contingency]_ decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.
