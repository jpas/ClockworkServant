### Description

The targets feathers thicken and fluff up to ward against winters chill. The target suffers no harm from being in a cold environment, and can exist comfortably in conditions as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creatures equipment is likewise protected. This spell doesnt provide any protection from cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards associated with cold weather (such as slipping on ice, blindness from snow, and so on).  

When you cast this spell, you may have the targets feathers turn white for the duration, granting it a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to hide in ice and snow.
