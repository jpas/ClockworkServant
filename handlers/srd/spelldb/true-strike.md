**School** divination; **Level** alchemist 1, arcanist 1, bloodrager 1, inquisitor 1, investigator 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, F (small wooden replica of an archery target)

### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** see text

### Description

You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.

## Mythic True Strike

The affected attack bypasses all damage reduction.   

**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +10 insight bonus on your second attack that round and a +5 insight bonus on your third attack that round. The second and third attacks can be on your turn or on another creatures turn before your next turn (such as when you attempt an attack of opportunity).
