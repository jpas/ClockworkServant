### Description

You create a spectrum of multicolored solid light that can be used for one of two effects.  

_Bow_: The spell creates a longbow or shortbow appropriate for your size, and you are proficient in the use of this weapon. When drawn, the bow automatically creates a _+1 seeking brilliant energy arrow_+1 seeking brilliant energy arrow; it cannot fire any other arrows. A creature struck by one of these arrows is surrounded by _[faerie fire]_ and dazzled for 1 minute. This version of the spell ends when you have fired a number of arrows equal to your caster level.  

_Bridge_: The light forms a bridge or ramp 5 feet wide and up to 10 feet long per caster level. Creatures on the bridge are dazzled. Allies gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) on checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will. Enemies take a penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will.
