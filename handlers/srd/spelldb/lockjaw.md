You give a creature the ability to use one of its natural attacks to firmly attach itself to an opponent. Choose one of the creatures natural attacks (usually a claw or bite attack).

A creature with multiple natural attacks can strike at its grappled opponent with its other natural attacks, but cannot attack any other creature.
