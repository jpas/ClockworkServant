### Description

This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects of spell, you roll two dice each time you make a Diplomacy check to change a creatures attitude, taking the highest roll. If this results in a roll low enough to reduce the creatures attitude by a step, that creature gets some clue that you are manipulating it with a spell. Alternatively you can cast this spell before making a Diplomacy check to gather information, gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check.
