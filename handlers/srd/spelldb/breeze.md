# Spell: Breeze

^([Paizo Blog - Ultimate Cantrips][ss-breeze] pg. 0 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-breeze])

**School** evocation (air); **Level** arcanist 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M (a miniature fan)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** one creature or object  

**Duration** 1 hour (D)  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

You create a light wind that blows against the target, from a direction of your choice. The breeze grants the subject a +2 bonus on saves against very hot conditions, severe heat, breath weapons, and saves against cloud vapors and gases (such as _[cloudkill]_, _[stinking cloud]_, and inhaled poisons). This spell does not function without air or underwater.  

You can only have one breeze active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.  

_Note from Jason Bulmahn_: The following spells are different from your standard cantrips. They are rare cantrips. Spellcasters that gain access to all 0-level spells at 1st level do not gain access to rare cantrips. A spellcaster gains access to rare cantrips only by uncovering their secrets in some other way. Some are guarded by jealous mages, while others are lost in missing libraries or molder on forgotten scrolls.  

These cantrips are not legal in Pathfinder Society play. Note that _[penumbra]_ was changed into the higher-level spell _[protective penumbra]_. The cantrip version is similar, but does not replace its higher-level counterpart.
