The blasts bull rush effect has a CMB bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). You are unaffected by both the spells damage and its bull rush effect, and may select up to one creature per 4 caster levels to also be ignored by the spells effects.
