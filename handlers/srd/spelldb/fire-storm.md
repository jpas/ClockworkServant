# Spell: Fire Storm

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-fire-storm] pg. 282 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-fire-storm])

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** cleric/oracle 8, druid 7, shaman 8

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  

**Area** two 10-ft. cubes per level (S)  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

When a _[fire storm]_ spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their Reflex save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a DC 20 Reflex save.

## Mythic Fire Storm

The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Half of this damage is fire damage, and the other half is divine energy that bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. You can exclude any number of animals from damage just as you can plant creatures.   

**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, choose one creature type (and subtype, if humanoid or outsider) to exclude from the effects of the spell. For each additional use of mythic power you expend when casting the spell, exclude another creature type. For example, if you expend two uses of mythic power and choose magical beasts, you can exclude from damage any number of magical beasts in the spells area.
