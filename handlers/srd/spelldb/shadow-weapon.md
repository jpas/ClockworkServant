### Description

Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapons attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects.  

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the _[shadow weapon]_ strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal.  

At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the frost or keen weapon property. The _[frost]_ and _[keen]_ properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save.  

The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession.

## Mythic Shadow Weapon

Add your tier to your caster level when determining what enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities the weapon can have. The weapon deals half damage to creatures that disbelieve in it and to objects, instead of only 1 point.  

You can spend a swift action to transform the weapon into a dull black metal ring on your finger, or to return it from its ring form to its weapon form in your hand.
