### Description

Your eidolons form shifts and transforms. This spell allows you to change any of the eidolons evolutions by allocating its evolution pool on new evolutions. If you have the aspect or greater aspect ability, this spell also allows you to change the evolution points spent to modify you, including removing or adding points as allowed by those abilities.

Your eidolon cannot benefit from this spell more than once per day. This spell does not allow you to change your eidolons base form.
