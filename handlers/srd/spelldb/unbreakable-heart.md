### Description

The target creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as _[crushing despair]_, _[rage]_, or fear effects) or that would force him to harm an ally (such as _[confusion]_). If the target is already under such an effect when receiving this spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of this spell. It does not affect mind-affecting effects based on positive emotions (such as _[good hope]_ or the inspire courage bard ability). A creature can still be charmed or otherwise magically controlled while under this spells effects, but if such a creature ever receives a new saving throw against that effect as a result of being ordered to attempt to harm or otherwise oppose a true ally, he can roll that saving throw twice and take the better result as his actual roll. _Calm emotions_ counters and dispels unbreakable heart.
