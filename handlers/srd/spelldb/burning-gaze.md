### Effect

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description

Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.

As a standard action as long as this spells effects persist, you may direct your _[burning gaze]_ against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from _[burning gaze]_.

Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attackfoes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.

## Mythic Burning Gaze

You may focus your burning gaze on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round its on fire.

**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spells duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.
