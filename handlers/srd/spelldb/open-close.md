# Spell: Open/Close

^([PRPG Core Rulebook][ss-open-close] pg. 317 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-open-close])

**School** transmutation; **Level** arcanist 0, bard 0, magus 0, skald 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, F (a brass key)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** object weighing up to 30 lbs. or portal that can be opened or closed  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

### Description

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.
