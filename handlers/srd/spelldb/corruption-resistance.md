### Description

You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects that inflict damage based on the target creatures alignment, such as _[holy smite]_, _[orders wrath]_, a paladins smite evil attack, or an _[unholy]_ weapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or law. The subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that specifically harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection increases to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipients equipment as well.

_Corruption resistance _protects against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities, not physical attacks._ Corruption resistance _only protects against damage. The subject can still suffer side effects from such attacks. When you use this spell to protect an alignment, it gains the descriptor of that alignment.
