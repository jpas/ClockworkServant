### Description

Any chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good creatures within the area of this spell suffer the following ill effects, based on their Hit Dice.  

**Hit Dice**| **Effect**  
---|---  
Equal to caster level| Sickened  
Up to caster level 1| Staggered, sickened  
Up to caster level 5| Nauseated, staggered, sickened  
Up to caster level 10| Killed, nauseated, staggered, sickened  

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects can attempt only one saving throw and apply the result to all the effects.  

_Sickened_: The creature is sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save negates the effect.  

_Staggered_: The creature is staggered for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the staggered effect to 1d4 rounds.  

_Nauseated_: The creature is nauseated for 1d10 minutes. A successful Will save reduces the nauseated effect to 1d4 rounds.  

_Killed_: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. A successful Will save negates this effect. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).  

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, all chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good extraplanar creatures within the area are banished back to their home planes (Will negates, at a 4 penalty). Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the _[arbitrament]_.  

Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by _[arbitrament]_.
