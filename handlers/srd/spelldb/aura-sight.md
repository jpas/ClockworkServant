### Effect

**Range** personal  

**Target** you  

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

### Description

This spell makes your eyes glow and allows you to see alignment auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a _detect chaos/evil/good/law_detect chaos/evil/good/law spell, but aura sight does not require concentration, and it discerns an auras location and power more quickly.  

You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras within your sight. An auras power depends on a creatures Hit Dice or an items caster level, as noted in the description of the _[detect evil]_ spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to determine the auras strength (one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a non-spell effect).  

_Aura sight_ can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_ spell by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.
