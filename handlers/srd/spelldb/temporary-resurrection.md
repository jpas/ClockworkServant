^([Ultimate Magic][ss-temporary-resurrection] pg. **LOOKUP** | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-temporary-resurrection])

**School** necromancy; **Level** arcanist 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes  

**Components** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 500 gp)

### Effect

**Range** touch  

**Target** dead creature touched  

**Duration** 24 hours

### Description

You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with _[raise dead]_). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast _[raise dead]_ or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with _[temporary resurrection]_, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
