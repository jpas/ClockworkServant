### Description

Upon casting this spell, all recipients gain the ability to speak a new language. This language sounds like random, babbling syllables to anyone not under the influence of the spell, but the targets understand each other perfectly.  

Anyone using _[codespeak]_ can read and write in this new language as well. Once the spell expires, however, any coded writing suddenly appears as gibberish. If the same individuals become the targets of a _[codespeak]_ spell again, cast by the same caster, they can once again read any coded writings.  

_Comprehend languages_ does not enable a caster to understand the language of anothers _[codespeak]_ spell, but it does reveal that the targets are speaking a magical language. _Tongues_ translates _[codespeak]_ normally.  

**Material Component** A complex rune inscribed on a slip of paper that is then placed under your tongue.
