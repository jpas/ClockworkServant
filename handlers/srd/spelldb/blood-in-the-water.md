### Description

As part of the casting of this spell, you must deal 1 point of piercing or slashing damage to yourself to release your blood. This causes you to take 1 point of bleed damage. While the spell is in effect, all sharks, feeders in the depths, and creatures with the blood frenzy ability in the area gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a 2 penalty to AC. This is treated as blood frenzy for the purposes of other feats and effects, and doesnt stack with the effects of actual blood frenzy. If you cease bleeding, the spell immediately ends.
