### Description

You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another creature, which can use it as if it were part of the creatures own path. If the target is unable to expend mythic power, it cant activate any part of the ability that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions as if the creature were 1st tier.  

While your path ability is transferred in this way, you cant use it yourself (even if its an automatic ability or one that doesnt require expending uses of mythic power).
