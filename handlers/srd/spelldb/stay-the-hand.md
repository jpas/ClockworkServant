### Description

You cause a creatures arm to waver and prevent it from striking another creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both accuracy and power, taking a 5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to a 2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally targeted for the duration of the spell.
