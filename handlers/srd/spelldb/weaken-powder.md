**School** transmutation; **Level** arcanist 1, druid 1, hunter 1, red mantis assassin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 standard action  

**Components** V, S, M/DF (an empty paper cartridge)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  

**Target** 1 loaded firearm  

**Duration** instantaneous  

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

### Description

Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge when fired. With such ammunition, the firearms range increment is halved and the firer takes a 2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spells effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearms user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.
