### Description

You unleash a powerful scream, inaudible to all but a single target. The target is dazed for 1 round and takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). A successful save negates the daze effect and halves the damage.

## Mythic Ear-Piercing Scream

The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) and the duration that creatures in the area are dazed is a number of rounds equal to your tier.  

**Augmented (3rd)**Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell affects a 30-foot cone rather than a single target.
