^([Chronicle of the Righteous][ss-summon-stampede] pg. 51 | PFS Legal | [Archives of Nehtys][sn-summon-stampede])

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 6, druid 6, hunter 6, summoner 4, warpriest 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round   

**Components** V, S, M (piece of fur from a herd animal) 

### Effect

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  

**Effect** 20-ft.-radius herd of animals  

**Duration** 1 round/level   

**Saving Throw** Reflex halves (see text); **Spell Resistance** no 

### Description

You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that immediately stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a 20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught in the herds path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they are trampled beneath dozens of animals hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.   

If the stampedes path would put it in an obviously dangerous area (such as over a cliff or through a fire) or force it to move through a solid barrier, the herd stops at the obstacle and moves in a new randomly determined direction until it reaches another obstacle or the spells duration ends.
