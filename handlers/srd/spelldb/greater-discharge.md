### Description

This spell functions as _[discharge]_, except it can discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.  

You choose to use _[greater discharge]_ in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.  

_Area Discharge_: When _[greater discharge]_ is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creatures possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.  

_Targeted Discharge_: This spell functions as _[discharge]_, but if the target is a creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the targets charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you possess.
