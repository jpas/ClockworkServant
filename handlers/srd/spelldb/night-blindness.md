### Description

This spell functions similarly to _blindness/deafness_blindness/deafness, except it only affects living creatures, and only causes blindness. The targets pupils constrict as if they were in bright sunlight, rendering them blind except in conditions of bright light, even if they have darkvision or low-light vision. The target gains a +4 to saving throws to resist blindness caused by bright light (such as _[flare]_, _[sunbeam]_, and _[sunburst]_, though in the latter two spells it is possible for a creature to fail its save against the damage while successfully resisting the blindness due to this bonus).
