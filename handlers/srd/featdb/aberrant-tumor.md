# Feat: Aberrant Tumor

_To the surprise of others, that strange growth on you is actually your spellcasting companion._

**Prerequisite**: Aberrant bloodline.

**Benefit**: You gain a tumor familiar, as the tumor familiar alchemist discovery, with an effective alchemist level equal to the level of the class that grants your aberrant bloodline for determining the tumor familiarâ€™s abilities. If multiple classes grant you the aberrant bloodline, those class levels stack for determining your effective alchemist level.
